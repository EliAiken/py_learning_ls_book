# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. 
# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

              ### MY ANSWERS HERE ###
# Different:
    # Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable
    # Lists ???

# Similar:
    # Lists and tuples are ordered 
    # Lists and tuples are heterogeneous
    # BONUS: Lists and tuples are sequences


            ### LAUNCH SCHOOL ANSWERS HERE ###
# Different:
    # Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
    # List literals use []; tuple literals use ()

# Similar:
    # Lists and tuples are both sequences; Sequences are ordered collections that 
    # can use numeric indexes to access the numbers
    # Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to be all the same type
